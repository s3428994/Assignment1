    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Australian born and raised; however my background is Turkish. We have a strong presence of Turkish culture in our home, with both my parents being born in Turkey but beginning their marriage in Australia. As a result, I was raised with both English and Turkish as a first language. </p>

    <p>I commenced Bachelor of Marketing at RMIT, but deferred multiple times. I eventually decided to take a more permanent break from the degree, and decided to take on an 8-month makeup diploma at the National Academy of Beauty to pursue my makeup hobby on a professional level.  Once that was completed I recommenced my Marketing Bachelor but once again found that I did not enjoy it after all. That’s when I decided to change directions and transfer to an IT degree, and applied for Computing Studies.</p>

    <p>My makeup diploma allowed me work as a freelance makeup artist, where I take on clients on weekends or even weekdays, depending on my availability. In addition to that, pursuing my hobby also allowed me to find a part time role as a Retail Artist at MAC Cosmetics.</p>



  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p> My interest in IT vaguely begun in highschool when I won an ICT award. That was a time also when customising your own websites via Piczo or Myspace was in, and I was obsessed with HTML codes and spent hours making my social sites look better. </p>
  <p>However, I was not able to take up any IT subjects in VCE as my school was not offering any at the time. That’s when I thought any future chances in IT had died. </p>
  <p>I chose to do my past and current Bachelor’s at RMIT mainly because it was a well known University, they offered a great range of various study streams that I had looked into (Business and IT), they were located in the City which meant I didn’t have to drive, and a majority of my friends had taken up their studies at RMIT too. All these factors played a role in my decision to attend RMIT. </p>

  <p> I’m hoping that my course will allow for a more engaging and practical study approach than my previous course, and hence give me the opportunity to work in an IT oriented field. I am hoping to merge my interest in beauty and makeup together with my IT pathway.  </p>

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  
  <p> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38446403?searchrequesttoken=2a60efb7-a8d2-4278-a3af-b88a67b1dcbe&type=standout">JOB LINK</a>  </p>
 
  <p>The position is of a Level 2 Service Desk Analyst for Mecca Brands. If not the most ideal job, it is definitely a position I would want to experience as it involves dealing with both software and hardware functionality of the systems. This would give me a great start into the IT world and I believe I can gain valuable experience from the role. The position is also offered at a cosmetic brand which merges my ideal dream to merge beauty and IT together. </p>

<p>The position requires 5 years of Windows software experience and 2 years prior experience at a similar Level 2 Analyst or Engineer role. Linux experience is also required but not at a minimum level, along with previous retail or service experience within the industry. </p>

<p>I currently only fulfil the requirement of working in retail, which totals to over 6 years. In order to obtain the role above, I would need to work and expand within an analyst role as a junior and work into a level 2 title. Ideally, the previous role will simultaneously allow me to work with Windows and Linux, hence allowing me to acquire the skill set required for this role. 

</p>


  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
  <u><h3> Myers-Briggs Test:</h3></u>
  <p>The ‘Entrepreneur’ personality results suggest that these traits are those of someone who may be willing to lead and take risks as they are outgoing, thinking and have a good outlook on matters. The visual traits of being more prospective and observant means that this personality type more that usually follows what they’ve seen and done rather than trusting their own gut or mind.  However the prominence of their turbulent trait may be the reason they may fail to manage or lead as they may be influenced easily or commonly by external factors.</p> 

<p>Working in a team, I would be happy to suggest or initiate ideas or talks, but always willing to hear the cooperation of other members so that the idea formed is with the contribution of all members. I believe these traits are generally reflected in me when I work in a group, social environment or even with friends. I tend to ignore my intuition as I do not always trust my inner feelings and thus prefer to learn and go off what I have previously seen or encountered.</p>

<p>In regards to forming a team, I believe all the traits are vital in working in a group, except for one – Turbulent. I believe I would have to work on this as it can be more of a negative trait to house. This means that I can be easily influenced emotionally and this may affect my decision making skills and cause unfavourable situations that may possibly turn into heated discussions.
</p>

  <h3><u>Learning Style Test:</u></h3>
<p>These results mean that an individual requires visual and/or physical learning tactics, which involves displays of supporting visuals of the text or that they would need to be actively involved in the learning process. 
  </p>
  
  <p>This is a great learning style for a team as it means that all members would be involved when learning as a tactile learning style suggests that involvement is required by a class or that physical activities would need to be conducted. Being a visual learner, it would be beneficial for the individual to additionally go over the material once again on their own, either by reading or writing it down, in order to help retain the earlier information better.
  </p>
  
  <p>When forming teams, it would be vital to consider that some information  would need to be involved in the learning or discussion process and hence doing a group activity while discussing ideas or projects would be an ideal start to the process. 
  </p>
  
  <h3><u>Abstract Reasoning Test:</u></h3>
  <p>
    This test aimed to measure my visual learning and thinking rate and how quickly I could solve potential problems. This is a trait that could serve an individual well however in a group involvement, quick responses may not be achieved due to the length of discussion by numerous members. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
When forming a team, it is ideal to possibly nominate the best individual who is strong at quick thinking, and hence would represent the whole team in group situations.
  </p>
  
  
  
  
  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <p>A project idea that combines my passion (makeup) and career (IT) into one would be a small yet significant development of an FAQ app that would be displayed as a Chatterbot with calculated responses. The app will respond to client inquiries to a travelling makeup artist about availability by taking into account the makeup artist’s existing bookings, location of bookings, day and time of inquiry, and length of application. All these factors will give the inquirer a yes or no response, and the earliest possible or most ideal time for appointment. </p>
<p>The project idea has resulted from a recent event involving a client where I declined her inquiry and responded with ‘unavailable’ after overestimating location and application time of an existing client. As a result, I left both myself out of pocket and rejected a potential client that could have been fit into the day. The aim is also to speed up inquiry and response times on both ends, and also help makeup artists to cater their product selection on the day to each of their clients.</p>
  <p>The app will be personalised for each individual makeup artist’s working times, days and lifestyle, hence the Chatterbot will respond accordingly. An initial inquiry from a potential client will help gain information of date, inquired time and location of the client. This info will then feed into the app. Any existing appointments will be taken into account, such as their time and location, and give an accurate estimate of what time the previous client will finish, how long it will take to travel from one client to another, and when the inquiring client’s makeup application will finalise, depending on the look (glam or bridal). </p>
  <p>If the inquiring client is happy with estimate times of arrival and application of the artist, and should choose to proceed, the artist can choose to request a photo of the client and ask the client to list any possible allergies. This is a great way for the makeup artist to pack (or avoid) required products accordingly to the client and eliminate any unnecessary products. </p>
  <p>The software that will play a vital role in responses is the data from an online map source such as Google Maps, as it will help determine location and route between clients. The app will run on both Android and iOS systems and hence iPhones and Samsung mobile devices will run the app. The programming code could possibly be developed via Java and will be another vital skill required in order to develop and enhance the app. The app could be developed by consulting an app development team who could project and lead the app’s start-up. The apps for iOS systems will need to be developed under xCode so that is another requirement. </p>
  <p>Once the app is live and well under use, it will help eliminate small but common problems that both clients and makeup artists face. These include:
•	A reduced waiting time of response from the artist
•	Immediate responses regarding availability due to built in calendar
•	Client will gain info on the duration of the application, based on their inquiry
•	Client will gain info on the estimated time of arrival of the artist and possible live info on their location 
•	Project the time of when the appointment will be finalised
•	Inform the artist of allergies and conditions and determine whether the artist has prior experience with similar clients
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the artist, the app will help benefit by:
•	Giving an accurate estimation of when next client’s appointment will commence
•	Eradicate and overestimated times
•	Reduce the number of refusals and encourage more client intake
•	Help organise and plan how many clients can be fit into the day depending on the time frame selected
•	Feed which dates the artist is unavailable and reduce unnecessary inquiries
•	Track the number of repeat clients
•	Set location limits
•	Gain awareness on any skin conditions or allergies and avoid the misuse of products on each client
  </p>
  
  <p> All in all, the app will play a vital role in the development and running of a small business where the artist works for themselves. It will be accessible via both artists and clients, where the artists will set the options and clients will inquire and choose from the available options. Its main role will be to give an insight on time because time is the most important factor when it comes to a travelling makeup artists. Clients choose to book travelling artists due to time and flexibility restraints on their end. For that reason, this app will help eradicate any problems, issues or inquiries that are based on time.</p>
