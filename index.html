    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am Australian born and raised; however my background is Turkish. We have a strong presence of Turkish culture in our home, with both my parents being born in Turkey but beginning their marriage in Australia. As a result, I was raised with both English and Turkish as a first language. </p>

    <p>I commenced Bachelor of Marketing at RMIT, but deferred multiple times. I eventually decided to take a more permanent break from the degree, and decided to take on an 8-month makeup diploma at the National Academy of Beauty to pursue my makeup hobby on a professional level.  Once that was completed I recommenced my Marketing Bachelor but once again found that I did not enjoy it after all. That’s when I decided to change directions and transfer to an IT degree, and applied for Computing Studies.</p>

    <p>My makeup diploma allowed me work as a freelance makeup artist, where I take on clients on weekends or even weekdays, depending on my availability. In addition to that, pursuing my hobby also allowed me to find a part time role as a Retail Artist at MAC Cosmetics.</p>



  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p> My interest in IT vaguely begun in highschool when I won an ICT award. That was a time also when customising your own websites via Piczo or Myspace was in, and I was obsessed with HTML codes and spent hours making my social sites look better. </p>
  <p>However, I was not able to take up any IT subjects in VCE as my school was not offering any at the time. That’s when I thought any future chances in IT had died. </p>
  <p>I chose to do my past and current Bachelor’s at RMIT mainly because it was a well known University, they offered a great range of various study streams that I had looked into (Business and IT), they were located in the City which meant I didn’t have to drive, and a majority of my friends had taken up their studies at RMIT too. All these factors played a role in my decision to attend RMIT. </p>

  <p> I’m hoping that my course will allow for a more engaging and practical study approach than my previous course, and hence give me the opportunity to work in an IT oriented field. I am hoping to merge my interest in beauty and makeup together with my IT pathway.  </p>

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

  <p>The position is of a Level 2 Service Desk Analyst for Mecca Brands. If not the most ideal job, it is definitely a position I would want to experience as it involves dealing with both software and hardware functionality of the systems. This would give me a great start into the IT world and I believe I can gain valuable experience from the role. The position is also offered at a cosmetic brand which merges my ideal dream to merge beauty and IT together. </p>

<p>The position requires 5 years of Windows software experience and 2 years prior experience at a similar Level 2 Analyst or Engineer role. Linux experience is also required but not at a minimum level, along with previous retail or service experience within the industry. </p>

<p>I currently only fulfil the requirement of working in retail, which totals to over 6 years. In order to obtain the role above, I would need to work and expand within an analyst role as a junior and work into a level 2 title. Ideally, the previous role will simultaneously allow me to work with Windows and Linux, hence allowing me to acquire the skill set required for this role.
